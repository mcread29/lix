Write for a technical audience (engineers, developers).

GOOD:

- Be precise, concrete, and specific.
- Explain _why_ before _how_ for new ideas.
- Define non-obvious terms once, then use them consistently.
- Make content skimmable: clear headings, short paragraphs, bullet points.
- Use active voice, present tense, and neutral tone.
- Use examples that are realistic and technically accurate.
- For steps: use imperative verbs (“Install”, “Configure”, “Run”).
- Put conditions before instructions (“If X applies, do Y.”).

BAD:

- Marketing language, hype, or superlatives (“powerful”, “revolutionary”).
- Vague claims without explanation or examples.
- Long unstructured paragraphs.
- Explaining obvious things or restating code in prose.
- Hand-wavy abstractions without concrete use cases.
- “Just”, “simply”, or “magically” solving hard problems.

Final check:

- Can a reader skim this and still understand the core idea?
- Does every section answer a real technical question?
