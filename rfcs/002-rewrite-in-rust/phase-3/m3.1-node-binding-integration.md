# M3.1 Node Binding Integration

Status: complete

## Scope

- Add monorepo package scaffold for the Node Rust engine binding.
- Lock first release target matrix to Linux x64.
- Create native crate location agreed in the rewrite plan.
- Extend native binary interface from routing-only (`route`) to execution planning (`plan`) for write/validation orchestration ownership.

## Delivered

- `packages/sdk-rust-engine-node/package.json`
- `packages/sdk-rust-engine-node/tsconfig.json`
- `packages/sdk-rust-engine-node/src/index.ts`
- `packages/sdk-rust-engine-node/src/index.test.ts`
- `packages/sdk-rust-engine-node/native/lix-engine/Cargo.toml`
- `packages/sdk-rust-engine-node/native/lix-engine/src/lib.rs`
- `packages/sdk-rust-engine-node/native/lix-engine/src/main.rs`

## Verification

- `pnpm --filter @lix-js/sdk-rust-engine-node test`
- `pnpm --filter @lix-js/sdk-rust-engine-node build`

Both commands pass on this branch, including `validation` statement routing and `planExecuteInRust` shape checks.
