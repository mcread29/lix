<context>
Phase 5 replaces the CLI planner with a native Node binding. The Rust engine must be exposed via NAPI-RS, providing a JS-facing API to create the engine and execute SQL while calling back into JS for host execution and plugin change detection.
</context>

<task>
Implement the NAPI-RS binding for the Rust engine, replace CLI planner usage, and wire JS host callbacks for SQLite execution.
</task>

<constraints>
- Keep support limited to Linux x64 unless explicitly extended.
- Do not remove legacy path; keep rollback option.
- Ensure NAPI binding preserves error taxonomy and marshalling parity.
- Provide end-to-end binding tests that assert callback invocation order.
</constraints>

<format>
NAPI-RS binding exported with `createEngine`/`execute`, tests passing in `@lix-js/sdk-rust-engine-node`.
