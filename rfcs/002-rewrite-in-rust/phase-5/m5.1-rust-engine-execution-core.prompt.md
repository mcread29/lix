<context>
Phase 5 of RFC 002 must move execution ownership into Rust. SDK still owns SQLite lifecycle and provides callbacks for SQL execution and plugin change detection. Prior phases 0-4 are archived; native planner is already wired. Rust engine must execute full read/write/validation flow and preserve SQLite dialect + passthrough behavior.
</context>

<task>
Implement the Rust engine execution core: parse SQL, rewrite reads/writes, validate mutations, orchestrate callbacks, and execute against host via callbacks per RFC 002.
</task>

<constraints>
- Do not change SQLite dialect behavior or passthrough behavior for non-rewrite statements.
- Do not move SQLite lifecycle ownership into Rust.
- Must preserve stable error taxonomy and deterministic behavior.
- Must cover read/write/validation/passthrough paths with tests.
</constraints>

<format>
Rust execution core implemented with unit/integration tests proving read/write/validation/passthrough behavior and deterministic error codes.
