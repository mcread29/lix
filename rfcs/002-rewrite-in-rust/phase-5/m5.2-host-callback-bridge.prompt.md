<context>
Phase 5 requires a Rust-to-JS host callback bridge matching RFC 002: Rust engine drives execution via host callbacks for SQL execution and plugin change detection. SDK retains SQLite ownership. Boundary marshalling must be deterministic and preserve error taxonomy.
</context>

<task>
Implement and verify the Rust host callback bridge: define the host trait, serialize/deserialize request/response envelopes, and enforce deterministic error surfaces across the boundary.
</task>

<constraints>
- Do not move SQLite lifecycle into Rust.
- Must preserve stable error codes and deterministic serialization.
- Must cover nulls, large integers, floats, blobs, JSON values, and structured errors.
- Must not change existing public SDK result shapes.
</constraints>

<format>
Rust host callback bridge implemented with parity tests covering boundary values and error surfaces.
