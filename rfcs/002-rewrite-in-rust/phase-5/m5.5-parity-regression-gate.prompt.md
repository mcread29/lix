<context>
Phase 5 must enforce full parity and performance regression gates once Rust execution is live. Benchmark comparisons must be documented and go/no-go checklist updated.
</context>

<task>
Run parity and performance regression gates for Rust execution, document benchmark comparison, and update go/no-go decision artifacts.
</task>

<constraints>
- Do not mark gates complete without verification evidence.
- Must run parity suites for read/write/validation and plugin change detection.
- Must document benchmark comparison vs legacy.
- Keep progress docs truthful and synchronized with evidence.
</constraints>

<format>
Parity suite and benchmark gate completed with documented evidence and updated go/no-go artifacts.
