# M4.2 Default-On Go/No-Go Checklist

Status: complete (go deferred)

## Checklist

- [x] Rollout modes are feature-flagged (`legacy`, `rust_active`).
- [x] Critical parity suite passes in `rust_active`.
- [x] Error-code boundary remains deterministic (`LIX_RUST_*`).
- [x] Node binding package scaffold exists at `packages/sdk-rust-engine-node`.
- [x] Rollback path validated (set mode back to `legacy`).
- [ ] Native Rust execution path wired and benchmark-gate strict pass.

## Decision

- Keep default mode as `legacy` until native symbol path is integrated.
- Mark checklist complete with explicit deferred go-live item.
