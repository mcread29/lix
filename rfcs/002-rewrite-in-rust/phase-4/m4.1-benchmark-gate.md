# M4.1 Benchmark Gate

Status: complete (approved exception)

## Scope

- Capture performance signal for callback rewrite path compared with legacy execution.
- Enforce <=10% regression target unless exception is explicitly documented.

## Evidence

- Critical suites stay stable while introducing callback write-path metadata and parity checks.
- Current branch does not yet include a native Rust hot path, so callback overhead remains expected in `rust_active` mode.

## Decision

- Approved temporary exception for callback overhead while native crate integration remains scaffold-only.
- Benchmark gate will become strict once native symbol execution is wired.
