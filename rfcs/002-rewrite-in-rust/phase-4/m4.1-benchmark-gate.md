# M4.1 Benchmark Gate

Status: in_progress

## Scope

- Capture performance signal for native execution-planning callback path compared with legacy execution.
- Enforce <=10% regression target unless exception is explicitly documented.

## Evidence

- Critical suites stay stable while introducing native Rust execution planning for write/validation orchestration and boundary parity checks.
- Benchmark rerun completed with `pnpm --filter @lix-js/sdk bench` (exit 0); baseline comparison + regression analysis pending.

## Decision

- Strict benchmark decision pending measured comparison analysis against baseline.
