# Design Log Index

Quick index for design logs in `design-log/`.

| ID | Title | Status | Last Updated | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#0001](./0001-state-of-lix.md) | Current State of Lix | Draft baseline | 2026-02-25 | Initial architecture and package snapshot |
| [#0002](./0002-preprocess-writes.md) | Preprocess Writes for state/state_by_version/vtable | Proposed | 2026-02-25 | Non-breaking write rewrite plan and exact affected SDK files |

## Conventions

- New logs use zero-padded IDs: `0002-...`, `0003-...`
- Keep statuses explicit: Draft baseline, Proposed, In implementation, Implemented
- Keep this index updated whenever a new design log is added
